# MazeSolver
Mazer Solver is a Java project, which can simulate different algorithms of solving an orthogonal maze.

I implemented a UI where user can design the maze and specify the start and destination.
I simulated the maze using a integer array full of ones and zeros. And a recursion searching method to do the 1st search.
Then I designed an optimization method which can get the possible loops and deadends, then for 2nd run, robot will head directly to the target.
